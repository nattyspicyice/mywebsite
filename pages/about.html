            <p class="about-paragraphs">Growing up, I lived right next door to miles and miles of forest. There were around 20+ miles of trails to explore, right in my own backyard. I have come to know these trails like the back of my hand. I've hiked them, I've biked them, and even rode horses through them. Now I'm 1000 miles away from where I grew up, but I'll never forget what the rustling leaves sounded like. Moving to Colorado meant being able to recreate that sense of exploration in a new place... this time with mountains! I've been really excited to hike and explore Colorado's beautiful trails. Nothing makes me feel more alive than being surrounded by nature, far enough away from the bustling city noise.</p>

            <p class="about-paragraphs">I firmly believe there is no feeling quite like getting immersed into the story of a good book. As a kid, I used to read every book I could get my hands on. I spent hours at the library, and it shows - I've never found a scent I love more than the smell of old books. These days, my to-read list never seems to get any shorter, as I'm always adding new books to it. I've added some of current to-read list below and detailed some of the progress I've made this year!</p>

            <p class="about-paragraphs">I picked up macrame a few years ago, when I decided I wanted to make all my friend's and family's Christmas presents that year. To this day, I still try my hand at some interesting designs. Most recently, I've made two lanterns out of some repurposed vintage lampshades!</p>
